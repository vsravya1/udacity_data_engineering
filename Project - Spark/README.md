****Project: Data Lake****

**Introduction**

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

***Project Description***

In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. You'll deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

***Project Datasets***

You'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data

**Song Dataset**

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

**Log Dataset**

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

***Schema for Song Play Analysis***

Using the song and log datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

**Fact Table**

songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong<br />
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

**Dimension Tables**

users - users in the app<br />
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level<br />
songs - songs in music database<br />
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration<br />
artists - artists in music database<br />
artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude<br />
time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units<br />
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

***ETL steps followed to complete the project***

Step1- Load the credentials from dl.cfg<br />
Step2- Load the Data which are in JSON Files(Song Data and Log Data)<br />
Step3- Use Spark process this JSON files and then generate a set of Fact and Dimension Tables<br />
Step4- Load back these dimensional process to S3<br />
Step5- Ran the etl script using python etl.py <br />
Step6- Used steps to validate if the logic/steps used in etl.py are working or not using .ipynb file.<br />
Step7- Removed credentials and other unused elements for saving the resources.<br />
Step8- Validated sample data, and respective directories created in S3<br />
Step9- Below screenshots valiate, job exuection from the terminal, target files created in S3 and the partitions for the required target tables.

***Steps to execute the project***
Step1 - Update AWS credentials in dl.cfg file.
Step2 - Run the etl.py file from the terminal.
