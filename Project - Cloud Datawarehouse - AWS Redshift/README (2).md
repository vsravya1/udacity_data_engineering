### **Introduction**
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As part of this project, need to build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

### **Project Description**
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

### **Project Datasets**
You'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json


### **Song Dataset**
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

### **Log Dataset**
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

### **Schema for Song Play Analysis**
Using the song and event datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

**Fact Table**

**songplays** - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

**Dimension Tables**

**users** - users in the app
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

**songs** - songs in music database
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

**artists** - artists in music database
artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude

**time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

### **Project Steps**
Below are steps you can follow to complete each component of this project.

### **Create Table Schemas**
Design schemas for your fact and dimension tables
Write a SQL CREATE statement for each of these tables in sql_queries.py
Complete the logic in create_tables.py to connect to the database and create these tables
Write SQL DROP statements to drop tables in the beginning of create_tables.py if the tables already exist. This way, you can run create_tables.py whenever you want to reset your database and test your ETL pipeline.
Launch a redshift cluster and create an IAM role that has read access to S3.
Add redshift database and IAM role info to dwh.cfg.
Test by running create_tables.py and checking the table schemas in your redshift database. You can use Query Editor in the AWS Redshift console for this.

### **Steps used to build an ETL pipeline**
1. Imported all necessary libraries
2. Created Redshift cluster and IAM role using AWS web console. 
3. Stored secruity , redshift cluster, S3 file details in the config file (dwh.cfg). Except S3 files, all other details were not enclosed in single quotes.
4. Tested through jupyter notebook to verify access to S3 files is working or not and its working
5. Tested through jupyter notebook to verify access to redshift cluster is working or not, there were issues accessing it. Adjusted paremeters to access the redshift cluster and inbound rules.
6. Added required steps in create_tables.py, sql_queries.py and etl.py scripts.
7. Validated data through AWS redshift query console.
8. For documenting purposes, captured record count screens from redshift console and also the record counts are available in CDWH_AWS_REDSHIFT.ipynb file
9. After verifying the data, removed all security details from the config file (dwh.cfg) and deleted redshift cluster using AWS web console.
