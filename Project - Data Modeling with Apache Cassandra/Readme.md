**Project: Data Modeling with Cassandra**

**Introduction:**

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data which they have been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. There is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data resides in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app. project is to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions.

**Project Overview:**

In this project, I would be applying Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python. I am provided with part of the ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.

**Datasets:**

In this project, we will be working on with one dataset: event_data. The directory of CSV files partitioned by date. Here are examples of filepaths to two files in the dataset: event_data/2018-11-0-events.csv event_data/2018-11-10-events.csv

**Project Template:**

The project template includes one Jupyter Notebook file, in which: • you will process the event_datafile_new.csv dataset to create a denormalized dataset • you will model the data tables keeping in mind the queries you need to run • you have been provided queries that you will need to model your data tables for • you will load the data into tables you create in Apache Cassandra and run your queries

**Project Steps:**

Below are steps you can follow to complete each component of this project.

Modelling your NoSQL Database or Apache Cassandra Database:

Design tables to answer the queries outlined in the project template
Write Apache Cassandra CREATE KEYSPACE and SET KEYSPACE statements
Develop your CREATE statement for each of the tables to address each question
Load the data with INSERT statement for each of the tables
Include IF NOT EXISTS clauses in your CREATE statements to create tables only if the tables do not already exist. We recommend you also include DROP TABLE statement for each table, this way you can run drop and create tables whenever you want to reset your database and test your ETL pipeline
Test by running the proper select statements with the correct WHERE clause

**Build ETL Pipeline:**

Implement the logic in section Part I of the notebook template to iterate through each event file in event_data to process and create a new CSV file in Python
Make necessary edits to Part II of the notebook template to include Apache Cassandra CREATE and INSERT three statements to load processed records into relevant tables in your data model
Test by running three SELECT statements after running the queries on your database
Finally, drop the tables and shutdown the cluster
Files:

**Project_1B_Project_Template.ipynb:** This was template file provided to fill in the details and write the python script

**Pjct_1B.ipynb:** This is the final file provided in which all the queries have been written with importing the files, generating a new csv file and loading all csv files into one. All verifying the results whether all tables had been loaded accordingly as per requirement

**Event_datafile_new.csv:** This is the final combination of all the files which are in the folder event_data

**Event_Data Folder:** Each event file is present separately, so all the files would be combined into one into event_datafile_new.csv
